# Kitty's PoV Chat
This module allows disabling of the automatic switching of the speaker's point-of-view character when selecting and deselecting tokens.
* With the Auto checkbox ticked, the PoV switches automatically with token selection, like in vanilla, but the portrait and actor name are shown to reflect the current selection.
* With the Auto checkbox unticked, the PoV is switched manually by selecting the actor from a dropdown menu.
* Actor portraits show up in chat next to messages as well!
* Clicking an actor portrait, in chat log or next to the PoV selection, will pan the scene to the relevant token if it's present.
